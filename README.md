# CUBESAT

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Objective: 
To Design and develop 1 unit Cubesat for tracking Weather Forecasts 
(Temperature, Humidity), Altitude, and Location and send the real-time data to 
the ground station 

## Mechanical Design & Fabrication: 
● Design a 1U CubeSat structure (<0.30 kg). 
● Ensure easy assembly and subsystem integration. 
● Perform structural integrity simulations. 
● Design an antenna deployment mechanism.

## Electronics & Electrical Systems: 
● Measure temperature, humidity, and altitude. 
● Transmit/receive real-time data via a 433 MHz monopole antenna. 
● Develop software for data processing, transmission, and antenna deployment. 
● Design a reliable electrical power system
